Going to be honest wish i started this on saturday.
I changed up most of the divs into different tags.
combined elements on the css.
tripped my way into the links working (added note i know what i did now youtube is very helpful).
For the most part i think i understand the first week of class (I think).
But somestuff did start click, my goals from here are to be more presistent on classwork.
And use askbcs alot more, so far have only learned from the people i have talked to.



Thank you for time
sincerely Adam J Fox
